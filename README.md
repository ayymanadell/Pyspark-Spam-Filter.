# Spam Filter Project

## Overview
The Spam Filter project is developed using PySpark and MLlib. The core classification algorithm used is Naive Bayes, a probabilistic method known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks like spam filtering. The project includes Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing steps to prepare and clean the text data, ensuring optimal performance of the spam filter model. By combining PySpark's distributed computing power, MLlib's machine learning algorithms, and NLP techniques, the project aims to accurately identify and filter spam emails, contributing to improved email management and user experience.

## Features
- Efficient handling of large datasets using PySpark's distributed computing capabilities.
- Utilization of Naive Bayes classifier from MLlib for effective text classification.
- NLP preprocessing techniques to prepare and clean text data for optimal model performance.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset, available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection). It contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam, making it suitable for training and evaluating spam filter models.
